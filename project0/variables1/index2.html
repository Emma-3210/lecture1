        <p>That had only two exits, or went out on the roof after a tiring climb, or went out in the chimney of the stove that was not working. </p>
        <p>It seems that the young lady preferred the second option and in desire research and discovery of new adventurous realms chose the stove chimney. Personally I found it much more interesting to climb to the roofs and certainly much cleaner than the ash from the stove. 
        </p>
        <p>Although climbing could do it on the chimney at home, she he chose the stove chimney , not the most immaculate and pure adventure. When I heard the noise I quickly ran to the next room to see what was happening. I was so sorry for her, when she heard me she started to meow and make more noise, she knew that I was there, he knew I was saving her. I didn't see her, I only saw the chimney from the stove, she was stuck there somewhere. </p>
        <p>
   I quickly called my brother to help me get her out of there. It was dark and she was very scared. My brother came quickly and was able to help me get her out of there. The problem was that you couldn't get her out so easily, she was stuck, stuck there, I knew I had to get her out quickly not to inhale too much ash, it was dangerous for the mythical of it. Finally my sister came, and the three of us tried to get her out of there. It was not easy, we had to remove the whole chimney from the stove so we can get her out. After a few minutes of hard work, we finally got her out. When we saw her, we couldn't believe that she is our cat,  all gray from head to toe. </p>
<p>It was hard for me to believe that she was, where was her immaculate white? where were her yellow spots? .... she was gone, everything was gray. I knew that it's her, I saw the joy and sparkle in her eyes as if to say "thank you". She was, I knew those little eyes and her sweetness, even the bow around her neck told me "it"s me, the grey but your cute cat". I all burst out laughing when I saw that it was all gray and full of it had turned gray, we were very happy that we could save it, and it was ours again, we had not lost it, we washed it and cleaned it, we were glad it was still alive, we could be best friends again, and that filled my heart with joy.</p>
